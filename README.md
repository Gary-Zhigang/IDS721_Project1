# IDS721_Project1
## Introduction
This is simple flask demo for the course IDS720, I used github's Codespaces as IaC and used AWS App Runner for the cloud deployment.
## Usage
For the local usage, you could use ``make install`` command to finish installation, and use ``python app.py`` command to run the website.  
For the cloud usage, you could click [this link](URL) to explore the calculator app.
